# AddRemoveList

This is my Qt project demonstrating how to do add/remove with two list panel views. 
What I learned from this project are how to do model/view, moving items between views, drap/drop reorder, installing event filter, connect SIGNAL/SLOT, how to use QModelIndex, return item from selected view and back to its original order.
